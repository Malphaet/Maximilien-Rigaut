/** @enum Message type
 * @brief The type of message sent through the socket
 * 
 * Keep in mind that, as an enum, this will be integers during runtime.
 * Beside that, don't be afraid if you see strange int in your packets.
 * 
 * Explanations of tags:
 * \li The tag [core] means it's only meant for the core program (you're the boss though)
 * \li The tag [program] means it's meant to be used by the program to cmmunicate.
 * \li The tag [msg] means the packet is carring a text-based message
 * \li The tag [nfo] means the packet is carring an information
 * \li The tag [wrn] means the packet is reporting a warning
 * \li The tag [err] means the packet is reporting an error
